    "USA is not a country of rich people. It‚Äôs a rich economy with many poor people fooled by illusion of wealth. Current state of the US: \n    üîπTotal Household debt: $18 trillion  \nüîπ$1.6 trillion in auto loans \nüîπ$1.6 trillion in student loans \nüîπ$1.2 trillion in credit card debt \nBut American media is strong and effective, convincing people that there is no alternative to the American economic system. \n (* Mortgage is the biggest debt at $12 trillion ‚Äî i.e., banks own the homes)! \n$DEBT AaGGKk5vEqhhBoEJK8eaei5M39srLWwFVBm8ucoHpump",
    
    "Just because you can make the payments doesn't mean you can afford it. \nThe only ‚Äúgood debt‚Äù is paid-off debt. Your most powerful wealth-building tool is your income. And when you spend your whole life sending loan payments to banks and credit card companies, you're making everyone else wealthy, and you end up with less money to save and invest for your own future. \n \n $DEBT AaGGKk5vEqhhBoEJK8eaei5M39srLWwFVBm8ucoHpump",

    "Good debt is when you borrow CHEAP money to make MORE money with it. \nBad debt is when you borrow money to buy things that go down in value. \n $DEBT AaGGKk5vEqhhBoEJK8eaei5M39srLWwFVBm8ucoHpump",

    "‚ÄúThe rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is slave to the lender.‚Äù If you owe someone money, they‚Äôll own your life until you pay it back. \n $DEBT AaGGKk5vEqhhBoEJK8eaei5M39srLWwFVBm8ucoHpump",

    "You have to live on less than you make in order to pay off debt, in order to save and invest, in order to be generous. You can‚Äôt spend more than you make and end up anywhere except bankruptcy court. And people are doing it every day, everywhere. \n The stuff I talk about is not hard to understand. It‚Äôs very hard to actually go and do it. \n You‚Äôve got to decide you‚Äôre going to DO it. Day in and day out, you‚Äôve drawn a line in the sand, and you are NOT going back. No more excuses. You‚Äôre taking control of your actions and your life. You‚Äôre ready to make your money work for YOU, not the other way around. \n \n $DEBT AaGGKk5vEqhhBoEJK8eaei5M39srLWwFVBm8ucoHpump",

    "Winning at money is 80 percent behavior and 20 percent head knowledge. What to do isn‚Äôt the problem; doing it is. Most of us know what to do, but we just don‚Äôt do it. If I can control the guy in the mirror, I can be skinny and rich. \n $DEBT AaGGKk5vEqhhBoEJK8eaei5M39srLWwFVBm8ucoHpump",

    "Your income is your most important wealth-building tool. And when your money is tied up in monthly debt payments, you‚Äôre working hard to make EVERYONE ELSE rich. \n You can‚Äôt build wealth when you‚Äôre sending your money to the bank every month. \n $DEBT AaGGKk5vEqhhBoEJK8eaei5M39srLWwFVBm8ucoHpump",

    "Financial peace isn‚Äôt the acquisition of stuff. It‚Äôs learning to live on less than you make. \n $DEBT AaGGKk5vEqhhBoEJK8eaei5M39srLWwFVBm8ucoHpump",

    "Poor people borrow for wants. \n Rich people borrow for returns. \nBad debt: Phones, luxury cars \n Good debt: Real estate, investments, personal growth. \n \n Used right, debt becomes leverage. \n $DEBT AaGGKk5vEqhhBoEJK8eaei5M39srLWwFVBm8ucoHpump",

    "Bad debt will keep you broke.\n\nAside from investment, education or medical costs, stop borrowing from your future income.\n\nStart buying future income by investing in assets that pay you instead of liabilities that cost you.\n\nCompound interest is a great servant but a bad master.\n\n$DEBT AaGGKk5vEqhhBoEJK8eaei5M39srLWwFVBm8ucoHpump",

    "The rules of debt are quite simple:\n\n1. Pay it back quick.\n2. Debt is not free money.\n3. Negotiate for a cheaper interest rate.\n4. Spare your kids from inheriting debt - use credit life insurance.\n5. If it is a business loan, use it for business not for personal spending.\n\n$DEBT AaGGKk5vEqhhBoEJK8eaei5M39srLWwFVBm8ucoHpump",
